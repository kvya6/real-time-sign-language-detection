#Real-Time  Sign Language (ASL) Recognition using CNN and deeplearning
This project implements a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition system using Computer Vision and Deep Learning. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on ASL hand gestures to detect and recognize 29 signs (A–Z + space, nothing, del) through a live webcam feed. Recognized signs are automatically converted into text to form full sentences for enhanced human-computer interaction.

## 📥 Download Dataset

To download the ASL Alphabet dataset from Kaggle:

1. Place your `kaggle.json` API key in `~/.kaggle/` (or same directory).
2. Run:

```bash
pip install kaggle
python download_dataset.py
note:✅ Best Practice: Add a Script to Download from Kaggle
Create a kaggle.json API key
Go to your Kaggle account:
https://www.kaggle.com/account

Scroll to API section → Click “Create New API Token”
